# Short description of this project
description: Generate a screenshot from any command. Supports SVG, JPG, PNG, or PDF.

introduction: |-
  This action generates a screengrab of any command using a combination of tools like script, aha, svg2html, and Puppeteer.

  Many similar tools exist list it, however they are optimized generally for recorded video or GIFs. 

  It's excellent for showcasing still frames of CLI tools or terminal output in your documentation.
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This action is optimized for generating static images, HTML or ANSI files.
  > If you need to generate a video or GIF, then you should use a different tool.
